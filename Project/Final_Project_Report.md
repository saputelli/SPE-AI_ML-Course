# AI for Energy Professionals Boot Camp: Final Project

## Project Title: **Predicting Oil Well Shut-ins for Proactive Intervention**

---

### 1. **Sample Use Case**

This project focuses on the **Upstream sector** of the energy industry. Specifically, it addresses the challenge of **predicting shut-in wells**. A "shut-in well" refers to an oil well whose output has diminished below economic thresholds, potentially due to reservoir depletion, pressure loss, or operational constraints. This problem is critical for optimizing production, preventing downtime, and ensuring the long-term economic viability of assets.

### 2. **Problem Definition**

The primary objective of this project is to **develop an AI/ML model capable of classifying oil wells as "shut-in" or "producing"**. By analyzing various operational parameters and historical data, the model aims to **identify wells at high risk of shutting in**, allowing for proactive intervention and optimized resource allocation. This is a **classification problem**, a supervised learning technique where the goal is to categorize data into predefined discrete classes.

### 3. **Background**

The energy industry continually seeks ways to enhance efficiency and reduce costs. In the Upstream sector, predicting well performance is paramount. Traditional methods for forecasting decline behavior, such as Arps models, often struggle with the complexities and uncertainties of modern reservoirs, particularly in unconventional plays, and may overestimate reserves. **AI/ML capabilities contribute significantly to this progression from descriptive to prescriptive analytics**, moving beyond just monitoring and analysis to providing predictions and recommendations.

AI/ML models offer a more robust approach by analyzing complex operational data to classify wells. This capability directly supports the boot camp's goal of equipping energy professionals with skills to solve common field development and reservoir management problems using AI and machine learning Python tools.

### 4. **Data Sources**

For this project, the model will leverage **historical operational data** from a set of oil wells. This data includes, but is not limited to:
*   **Production rates (oil, gas, water)**
*   **Downhole pressure and temperature readings**
*   **Water cut**
*   **Gas-Oil Ratio (GOR)**
*   **Operational events/logs** (e.g., stimulation treatments, maintenance activities)
*   **Well attributes** (e.g., completion type, formation characteristics)

The data input process for any AI/ML model is crucial for its success. It typically involves three stages:
1.  **Data Collection**: Gathering raw data from various sources, such as sensors, databases, or existing files.
2.  **Data Cleaning (or Wrangling)**: Identifying and correcting errors, inconsistencies, and **handling missing values** (e.g., imputing or removing) and **dealing with duplicates** by identifying and removing redundant records. This stage also includes outlier detection and treatment, and ensuring correct data types.
3.  **Data Transformation**: Converting cleaned data into a suitable format and scale for the chosen machine learning algorithm. This may involve **feature scaling/normalization**, **encoding categorical variables**, and **feature engineering** (creating new features from existing ones to improve model performance).

### 5. **Code Structure**

The project codebase will be organized to promote modularity, readability, and reproducibility. A recommended structure is:

```

**Key Python Libraries** that will be utilized include:
*   **NumPy**: For numerical computing with multi-dimensional arrays.
*   **Pandas**: For powerful data analysis and manipulation with DataFrames.
*   **Scikit-learn (sklearn)**: Providing various machine learning tools for classification, regression, clustering, and model evaluation.
*   **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For creating static, animated, and interactive data visualizations and attractive statistical graphics.

### 6. **Performance Analysis**

For this classification task, model performance will be evaluated using standard metrics to ensure the model's effectiveness and reliability:
*   **Accuracy**: The proportion of correctly classified instances.
*   **Precision**: The proportion of positive identifications that were actually correct.
*   **Recall (Sensitivity)**: The proportion of actual positives that were correctly identified.
*   **F1-score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric that balances both.
*   **AUC-ROC Curve**: A performance measurement for classification problems at various threshold settings. It assesses the model's ability to distinguish between classes.

### 7. **Results**

The project will present the following key results:
*   **Model Performance Report**: A detailed report outlining the chosen model's performance metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC) on a held-out test set.
*   **Feature Importance Analysis**: Insights into which operational parameters (e.g., oil rate, bottomhole pressure, water cut) are most influential in predicting well shut-ins. Libraries like Scikit-learn can help extract these insights.
*   **Visualizations**: Graphs and charts illustrating key trends, model predictions vs. actual outcomes, and the distribution of important features (e.g., using Matplotlib and Seaborn).
*   **Identified At-Risk Wells**: A list or dashboard showing wells identified by the model as being at high risk of shutting in, along with their predicted probability.

### 8. **Conclusion**

This project successfully demonstrates the application of AI/ML techniques to address a real-world challenge in the Upstream energy sector: predicting oil well shut-ins. By leveraging historical operational data and supervised learning algorithms, the developed model provides a robust tool for identifying wells requiring intervention, ultimately contributing to **proactive asset management** and **optimized production strategies**. This practical application of learned AI/ML techniques consolidates the skills acquired during the boot camp.

### 9. **Way Forward**

Future enhancements and directions for this project could include:
*   **Exploring advanced ML models**: Implementing **Bayesian Neural Networks** to quantify uncertainty in predictions or experimenting with **ensemble ML models** (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, GRU) for more robust decline prediction.
*   **Incorporating Time-Series Forecasting**: Instead of just classification, using time-series models to predict the exact time frame until a well might shut in, accounting for temporal dependence, trends, and seasonality.
*   **Integration with Real-time Data**: Connecting the model to live **SCADA systems** (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition systems) for real-time anomaly detection and operational insights, facilitating automatic control and immediate alerts.
*   **Reinforcement Learning for Optimization**: Investigating how Reinforcement Learning could optimize intervention strategies (e.g., when to perform workovers) based on predicted shut-in risks and economic factors.
*   **Deployment**: Exploring options for deploying the model, potentially using cloud platforms like Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook for rapid prototyping, or moving towards a production environment with MLOps tools.
*   **Explainable AI (XAI)**: Further utilizing tools like SHAP values to enhance model interpretability, helping domain experts understand why a particular well is flagged as high-risk.
