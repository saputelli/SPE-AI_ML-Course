# Rod_Pump_Optimization 
From: Nicholas Khami, Nashra Ali, Vrishank Jannu

This repository presents an implementation of a Random Forest Regression to predict the timing of a sucker rod pump failure. The data used for building the following model is provided by ConocoPhillips. The aim of this product is to assist production engineers in hypothesizing a better design for the downhole set-up in order to extend pump lifetimes. Thus, the company can cut yearly maintainence costs (i.e. part replacement) and consequently see an increase oil production per well. This benefits the company in guranteeing a higher return on their investments.
