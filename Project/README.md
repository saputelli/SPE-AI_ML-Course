# SPE-AI_ML-Course Final Project

Participants to develop their own application of AI and ML techniques to a sample dataset relevant to their work challenges. The boot camp's objective is to enable participants to "tackle common problems in upstream, midstrean and downstream effectively using AI and machine learning Python tools.

### Project Steps:
* Define the problem: what problem can be addressed with simple AI/ML methods?
* Define project, success metrics (accuracy, time savings, decision making)
* Define and access required data sources and types (use ony publicly available data or synthetic data)
* Define required algorithm steps: data loading, cleaning, transforming, model train, prediction, visualization
* Build code
* Assess model performance (error, predictability)

### Deliverables:
1. Final Report (Create a Final_Project_Report.md)
- Problem definition, Background, Data Sources, 
- Code structure, performance analysis
- Results, Conclusion, Way Forward

2. Github Rerpository
- Create a Public Github Repository
- Add you code, data and Final_Project_Report.md

### Notes:
Participants will have ~2 weeks to submit their project results as a final presentation and code. 
All participant will recieve an SPE Bahrain Certificate of Achievement - AI & ML in Energy Industry
Top projects will be showcased in the following SPE Bahrain Local section meeting in August 2025

### Always use publicly available data or synthetic data
